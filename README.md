# Product landing page project

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my custom design in Figma for desktop and mobile + made into code

## My process

For the website design, I chose a modern dark theme and a hero landing page format.

The design features a minimalist look that appears modern and is suitable for the business sector it represents. The fictional store specializes in renting cameras, camcorders, and accessories.

The website continues the minimalist look and focuses on simplicity for better product selection and clarity. It uses modern CSS animations that animate the pictures when hovering over the buttons, giving the page a more lively look.

The website is translated from the original Figma design into clean HTML and CSS code. The project is done without the use of libraries and other frameworks.

Like all my projects, this one also has an uncluttered version for desktop and mobile. When coding, I focus on every detail to enhance the display on various devices.

I follow the rules for responsive web design and start my code with "mobile first" style. Several times during the conversion of the design into code, I check whether the appearance is still correct on different device sizes and orientations to achieve an optimal result.
